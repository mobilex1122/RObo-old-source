# RObo-old-source
RObo (old) is relased as open source under MIT license.
Thys project is no longer in development and is being rewriten and published as RObonox.

Source code is in really bad condition (I'm sorry i broke lots of things in the game so rewrite was the only way out.) but if you can fix it you can use it as your project.
